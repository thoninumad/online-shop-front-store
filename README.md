# Deployment

We're using Vercel CLI to deploy the App. The process are relatively easy.

First install the Vercel CLI globally on your machine:

```
npm i -g vercel
```

Don't forget to clone the repo to your local machine:

```
git clone <this repo>
```

Then deploy the app (make sure you're inside the app root directory)

```
vercel deploy --prod
```

**Note:** Say yes to all Vercel CLI prompt. Make sure you have a Vercel account connected with the CLI.

Then, you're done deploying ðŸŽ‰
